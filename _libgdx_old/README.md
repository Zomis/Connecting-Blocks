Connecting-Blocks
=================

A game about moving, connecting, disconnecting, and modifying connections of blocks.

The game concept can be described with these images:

At first you have one or more connections that you can control.

When they are moved adjacent to another, they get stuck together.

Your goal is to cover all green tiles with a connection.

Connections might be too big to move through an obstacle.

By breaking the connection, it is split in two so you can control each connection individually.

Sometimes, a connection will not have the form you want it to have.

So you will have to modify it.
